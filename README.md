# AREESH

# Week 7 Group Project

This app uses speech-recognition technology to help you test your memory and sharpen your spelling skills!

Just tell the app the word you want to spell. It will appear on your screen briefly before disappearing. 

Now over to you. Spell the word out loud, and AREESH will let you know if you get it right.

## User Stories

### MVP

As a user:
* I want to be presented with the correct spelling of a word when I say it out loud so that I can learn how to spell it
* I want to be presented with the definition the word when I say it out loud so that I can make sure it is the word I meant
* I want to get live feedback, letter-by-letter, as I spell a word out loud so I that I can add it to my active vocabulary and train my memory
* I want to be able to see my total number of completed words so I can keep track of my learning progress during each session
* I want to be able to see the rules of the game when I log in, so I know how to play

### Stretch
As a user:
  * I want to be able to view a graph displaying my history of completed words over time, so I can track my learning progress

```

## Heroku!!!

### Creating your app

Create your app with `heroku create [name]`

You can check that this was successful by running `heroku apps` to view a list of your apps


### Adding postgres
AREESH
Login

Add postgresql (hobby dev) to your app at `https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/[APP NAME HERE]/resources`

Check that pg has been added by running `heroku addons` to ensure the postgresql db is on your app


### Deploying!

I have created several npm scripts that will be useful for deploying your app to heroku easily.

To push your local master branch to your heroku app:
```sh
npm run h:deploy
```

Run heroku migrations:
```sh
npm run h:migrate
```

Run heroku seeds:
```sh
npm run h:seed
```

If ever you need to rollback, you can also:
```sh
npm run h:rollback
```


### Ta-Da!
Your app should be deployed!
